% Make the noise term, eta
% Gaussian distributed (this could be specified as an additional input to
% make this code more general, and it could take that input from
% MkSg_noise). You could even pass general signals in for the noise term
% and treat this as a filter... In fact, I think you can do all this much
% more elegantly using the filter command in MATLAB... But I'm lazy and
% also enjoy making my own less efficient code.
noise = randn(N+eta,1);
x = zeros(N+eta,1);

order = length(params);
% will need this many initial conditions
% taken from uniform random distribution
% Could do nothing (i.e., take from uniform distribution of zeros)- we're
% removing transient so for the stationary processes, this shouldn't
% matter.
x(1:order) = rand(order,1);

for i=order+1:N+eta
    x(i) = params'*x(i-order:i-1) + noise(i);

s = x(eta+1:end);
